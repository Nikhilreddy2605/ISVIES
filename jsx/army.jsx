        The Indian Army is the land-based branch and largest component of the
        Indian Armed Forces. The President of India is the Supreme Commander of
        the Indian Army, And professional head is the Chief of Army Staff
        (COAS). The Indian Army was established on 1 April 1895 alongside the
        long established presidency armies of the East India Company, which too
        were absorbed into it in 1903. Some princely states maintained their own
        armies which formed the Imperial Service Troops along with the Indian
        Army formed the land component of Armed Forces of Crown of India,
        responsible for defence of the Indian Empire.The Imperial Service Troops
        were merged into the Indian Army after independence.The units and
        regiments of the Indian Army have diverse histories and have
        participated in several battles and campaigns around the world, earning
        many battle and theatre honours before and after Independence. The
        primary mission of the Indian Army is to ensure national security and
        national unity, to defend the nation from external aggression and
        internal threats, and to maintain peace and security within its borders.
        It conducts humanitarian rescue operations during natural calamities and
        other disturbances, such as Operation Surya Hope, and can also be
        requisitioned by the government to cope with internal threats. It is a
        major component of national power, and to alongside the Indian Navy and
        the Indian Air Force. The independent Indian army has been involved in
        four wars with neighbouring Pakistan and one with China. Other major
        operations undertaken by the army include Operation Vijay, Operation
        Meghdoot, and Operation Cactus. The army has conducted large peacetime
        exercises such as Operation Brasstacks and Exercise Shoorveer, and it
        has also been an active participant in numerous United Nations
        peacekeeping missions. The Indian Army was a major force in the First
        and Second World Wars, particularly in the Western Front and the Middle
        Eastern theatre during World War I, and the South-East Asian Theatre and
        the East African and North African campaigns during World War II. The
        Indian Army is operationally and geographically divided into seven
        commands, with the basic field formation also being a division. Below
        the division level are permanent regiments that are responsible for
        their own recruiting and training. The army is an all-volunteer force
        and comprises more than 80% of the country's active defence personnel.
        It is the largest standing army in the world, with 1,237,117 active
        troops and 960,000 reserve troops.The army has embarked on an infantry
        modernisation program known as Futuristic Infantry Soldier As a System
        (F-INSAS), and is also upgrading and acquiring new assets for its
        armoured, artillery, and aviation branches. History Until the
        independence of India, the "Indian Army" was a British-commanded force
        defined as "the force recruited locally and permanently based in India,
        together with its expatriate British officers"; the "British Army in
        India" referred to British Army units posted to India for a tour of
        duty. The "Army of India" meant the combined Indian Army and the British
        Army in India.In 1776, a Military Department was created within the
        government of the East India Company at Calcutta. Its main function was
        to record orders that were issued to the army by the various departments
        of the East India Company for the territories under its control. With
        the Charter Act of 1833, At the Secretariat of the government of the
        East India Company was reorganised into four departments, including a
        Military Department. The army which in the presidencies of Bengal,
        Bombay and Madras functioned as respective Presidency Armies until 1
        April 1895, when they were unified into a single force known as the
        Indian Army. For administrative convenience, it was divided into four
        commands, namely Punjab (including the North West Frontier), Bengal,
        Madras (including Burma), and Bombay (including Sind, Quetta and Aden).
        The Indian Army was a critical force for maintaining the primacy of the
        British Empire, both in India and throughout the world. Besides
        maintaining internal security, the Army which fought in many other
        theatres: Third Anglo-Afghan war; the Boxer Rebellion in China; in
        Abyssinia and in the First and Second World Wars.

      <p className="paragraph2">
        The Kitchener Reforms brought the British Army to a new century. In the
        20th century, the Indian Army was a crucial adjunct to the forces of the
        British Empire in both world wars. 1.3 million Indian soldiers served in
        World War I (1914-1918) with the Allies, in which 74,187 Indian troops
        were killed or missing in action. In 1915 there was a mutiny by Indian
        soldiers in Singapore. The United Kingdom made promises of
        self-governance to the Indian National Congress in return for its
        support but reneged on them after the war, following which the Indian
        Independence movement gained strength. The "Indianisation" of the Indian
        Army began with the formation of the Prince of Wales Royal Indian
        Military College at Dehradun, in March 1912, to provide education to the
        scions of aristocratic and well-to-do Indian families and to prepare
        selected Indian boys for admission into the Royal Military College,
        Sandhurst. Cadets were given a King's commission, after passing out, and
        were posted to one of the eight units selected for Indianisation.
        Because of the slow pace of Indianisation, with just 69 officers being
        commissioned between 1918 and 1932, political pressure was applied,
        leading to the formation of the Indian Military Academy in 1932 and
        greater numbers of officers of Indian origin being commissioned. On the
        eve of World War II, the officer corps consisted of roughly 500 Indians
        holding regular commissions against approximately 3,000 British
        officers. In World War II Indian soldiers fought alongside the Allies.
        In 1939, British officials had no plan for expansion and training of
        Indian forces, which comprised about 130,000 men (in addition there were
        44,000 men in British units in India in 1939), whose mission was
        internal security and defence against a possible Soviet threat through
        Afghanistan. As the war progressed, the size and role of the Indian Army
        expanded dramatically, and troops were sent to battlefronts as soon as
        possible. The most serious problem was the lack of equipment. Indian
        units served in Burma, wherein 1944-45, five Indian divisions were
        engaged along with one British and three African divisions. Even larger
        numbers operated in the Middle East. Some 87,000 Indian soldiers died in
        the war. By the end of the war, it had become the largest volunteer army
        in history, rising to over 2.5 million men in August 1945. In the
        African and Middle East campaigns, captured Indian troops were given a
        choice to join the German Army, to eventually "liberate" India from
        Britain, instead of being sent to POW camps. These men, along with
        Indian students who were in Germany when the war broke out, made up what
        was called the Free India Legion. They were originally intended as
        pathfinders for German forces in Asia but were soon sent to help guard
        the Atlantic Wall. Few who were part of the Free India Legion ever saw
        any combat, and very few were ever stationed outside Europe. At its
        height, the Free India Legion had over 3,000 troops in its ranks. Indian
        POWs also joined the Indian National Army, which was allied with the
        Empire of Japan. It was raised by a former colonel of the Indian Army,
        General Mohan Singh, but was later led by Subhas Chandra Bose and Rash
        Bihari Bose. With the fall of Singapore in 1942, about 40,000 Indian
        soldiers were captured. When given the choice, over 30,000 joined the
        Indian National Army. Those who refused became POWs and were mostly
        shipped to New Guinea. After initial success, this army was defeated,
        along with the Japanese; but it had a huge impact on the Indian
        independence movement.

      <h1 className="heading3">Indian independence</h1>
      <p className="paragraph3">
        Upon the Partition of India and Indian independence in 1947, four of the
        ten Gurkha regiments were transferred to the British Army. The rest of
        the Indian Army was divided between the newly created Union of India and
        the Dominion of Pakistan. The Punjab Boundary Force, which had been
        formed to help police Punjab during the partition period, was disbanded.
        Headquarters Delhi and the East Punjab Command were formed to administer
        the area. The departure of virtually all senior British officers
        following independence, and their replacement by Indian officers, meant
        many of the latter held acting ranks several ranks above their
        substantive ones. For instance, S. M. Shrinagesh, the ground-forces
        commander of Indian forces during the first Indo-Pak War of 1947-49 (and
        the future third COAS), was first an acting major-general and then an
        acting lieutenant-general during the conflict while holding the
        substantive rank of major, and only received a substantive promotion to
        lieutenant-colonel in August 1949. Gopal Gurunath Bewoor, the future
        ninth COAS, was an acting colonel at his promotion to substantive major
        from substantive captain in 1949, while future Lieutenant General K. P.
        Candeth was an acting brigadier (substantive captain) at the same time.
        In April 1948, the former Viceroy's Commissioned Officers (VCO) were
        re-designated Junior Commissioned Officers, while the former King's
        Commissioned Indian Officers (KCIO) and Indian Commissioned Officers
        (ICO), along with the former Indian Other Ranks (IOR), were respectively
        re-designated as Officers and Other Ranks. Army Day is celebrated on 15
        January every year in India, in recognition of Lieutenant General K. M.
        Cariappa's taking over as the first "Indian" Chief of the Army Staff and
        Commander-in-Chief, Indian Army from General Sir Roy Bucher, on 15
        January 1949. With effect from 26 January 1950, the date India became a
        republic, all active-duty Indian Army officers formerly holding the
        King's Commission were recommissioned and confirmed in their substantive
        ranks.

      <h3 className="smallheading1">First Kashmir War (1947)</h3>
      <p className="paragraph4">
        Immediately after independence, tensions between India and Pakistan
        erupted into the first of three full-scale wars between the two nations
        over the then princely state of Kashmir. The Maharaja of Kashmir wanted
        to have a standstill position. Since Kashmir was a Muslim majority
        state, Pakistan wanted to make Kashmir a Pakistani territory. As a
        result, Pakistan invaded Kashmir on 22 October 1947, causing Maharaja
        Hari Singh to look to India, specifically to Lord Mountbatten of Burma,
        the governor-general, for help. He signed the Instrument of Accession to
        India on 26 October 1947. Indian troops were airlifted to Srinagar from
        dawn on 27 October. This contingent included General Thimayya who
        distinguished himself in the operation and in the years that followed
        became a Chief of the Indian Army. An intense war was waged across the
        state and former comrades found themselves fighting each other. Pakistan
        suffered significant losses. Its forces were stopped on the line formed
        which is now called the Line of Control (LOC).[citation needed] An
        uneasy peace, sponsored by the UN, returned by the end of 1948, with
        Indian and Pakistani soldiers facing each other across the Line of
        Control, which has since divided Indian-held Kashmir from that part held
        by Pakistan. Several UN Security Council resolutions were passed, with
        Resolution 47 calling for a plebiscite to be held in Kashmir to
        determine accession to India or Pakistan, only after Pakistan withdrew
        its army from Kashmir. A precondition to the resolution was for Pakistan
        and India to return to a state of "as was" before the conflict. Pakistan
        would withdraw all tribesmen and Pakistani nationals brought in to fight
        in Kashmir. Pakistan refused to pull back, and there could be no further
        dialogue on fulfilling the UN resolution. Tensions between India and
        Pakistan, largely over Kashmir, have never been eliminated.

      <h3 className="smallheading2">Annexation of Hyderabad (1948)</h3>
      <p className="paragraph5">
        After the partition of India, Hyderabad State, a princely state under
        the rule of the Nizam of Hyderabad, chose to remain independent. The
        ensuing stand-off between the Government of India and the Nizam ended on
        12 September 1948, when India's then Deputy Prime Minister Sardar
        Vallabhbhai Patel ordered Indian troops to secure Hyderabad State.
        During five days of fighting, the Indian Army, backed by an Indian Air
        Force squadron of Hawker Tempest aircraft, routed the Hyderabad State
        forces. Five Indian Army infantry battalions and one armoured squadron
        were engaged in the operation. The following day, Hyderabad was
        proclaimed part of India. Major General Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri, who led
        the operation, and accepted the surrender of the Nizam's forces on 18
        September 1948, was appointed the military governor of Hyderabad, to
        restore law and order, and served until 1949.

      <h3 className="smallheading3">Indo-Pakistani War of 1965</h3>
      <p className="paragraph6">
        A second confrontation with Pakistan took place in 1965. Although the
        war is described as inconclusive, India had the better of the war and
        was the clear winner in tactical and strategic terms.
        Pakistani president Ayub Khan launched Operation Gibraltar in August
        1965, during which Pakistani paramilitary troops infiltrated into
        Indian-administered Kashmir and attempted to ignite anti-India agitation
        in Jammu and Kashmir. Pakistani leaders believed that India, which was
        still recovering from the Sino-Indian War, would be unable to deal with
        a military thrust and a Kashmiri rebellion. India reacted swiftly and
        launched a counter-offensive against Pakistan. In reply, on 1 September
        Pakistan launched Operation Grand Slam, invading India's Chamb-Jaurian
        sector. In retaliation, the Indian Army launched a major offensive all
        along its border with Pakistan, with Lahore as its prime target.
        Initially, the Indian Army met with considerable success in the northern
        sector. After launching prolonged artillery barrages against Pakistan,
        India was able to capture three important mountain positions in Kashmir.
        By 9 September, the Indian Army had made considerable inroads into
        Pakistan. India had its largest haul of Pakistani tanks when an
        offensive by Pakistan's 1st Armoured Division was blunted at the Battle
        of Asal Uttar, which took place on 10 September near Khemkaran.The
        biggest tank battle of the war was the Battle of Chawinda, the largest
        tank battle in history after World War II. Pakistan's defeat at the
        Battle of Asal Uttar hastened the end of the conflict. At the time
        of the ceasefire declaration, India reported casualties of about 3,000.
        On the other hand, it was estimated that more than 3,800 Pakistani
        soldiers were killed in the conflict. About 200-300
        Pakistani tanks were either destroyed or captured by India. India lost a
        total of 150-190 tanks during the conflict. The decision to
        return to pre-war positions, following the Tashkent Declaration, caused
        an outcry in New Delhi. It was widely believed that India's decision to
        accept the ceasefire was due to political factors, not military, since
        it was facing considerable pressure from the United States and the
        United Nations to cease hostilities.
