        The Indian Navy is the maritime branch of the Indian Armed Forces. The
        President of India is the Supreme Commander of the Indian Navy. The
        Chief of Naval Staff, a four-star admiral, commands the navy. As a
        blue-water navy, it operates significantly in the Persian Gulf Region,
        the Horn of Africa, the Strait of Malacca, and routinely conducts
        anti-piracy operations and partners with other navies in the region. It
        also conducts routine two to three month-long deployments in the South
        and East China seas as well as in the western Mediterranean sea
        simultaneously. The primary objective of the navy is to safeguard the
        nation's maritime borders, and in conjunction with other Armed Forces of
        the union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the
        territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace.
        Through joint exercises, goodwill visits and humanitarian missions,
        including disaster relief, the Indian Navy promotes bilateral relations
        between nations. As of June 2019, the Indian Navy has 67,252 active and
        75,000 reserve personnel in service and has a fleet of 150 ships and
        submarines, and 300 aircraft. As of September 2022, the operational
        fleet consists of 2 active aircraft carriers and 1 amphibious transport
        dock, 4 landing ship tanks, 8 landing craft utility, 12 destroyers, 12
        frigates, 2 ballistic missile submarines, 16 conventionally-powered
        attack submarines, 18 corvettes, one mine countermeasure vessel, 4 fleet
        tankers and numerous other auxiliary vessels, small patrol boats and
        sophisticated ships. It is considered as a multi-regional power
        projection blue-water navy.

      <h1 className="navyheading2">Early Maritime History</h1>
      <p className="navypara102">
        The maritime history of India dates back 6,000 years to the pre-Indus
        Valley civilisation. A Kutch mariner's log book from 19th century
        recorded that the first tidal dock in India was built at Lothal around
        2300 BC during the Indus Valley Civilisation, near the present-day
        harbor of Mangrol on the Gujarat coast. The Rig Veda credits Varuna, the
        Hindu god of water and the celestial ocean,with knowledge of the ocean
        routes and describes the use of ships having hundred oars in the naval
        expeditions by Indians. There are also references to the side wings of a
        ship called Plava, which stabilise the vessel during storms. Plava are
        considered to be the precursors of modern-day stabilisers. Alexander the
        Great, during his campaigns in India, built a harbour at the ancient
        city of Patala, which has been hyphothzied to be the present day city of
        Thatta. His army retreated to Mesopotamia using ships built at Sindh. In
        the period after his conquest, records show that the Emperor of Maurya
        Empire, Chandragupta Maurya, as a part of his war office, established an
        Admiralty Division. Many historians from ancient India recorded Indian
        trade relations. Indian trade reached Java and Sumatra. There were also
        references to the trade routes of countries in the Pacific and Indian
        Ocean. India also had trade relations with the Greeks and the Romans. At
        one instance Roman historian Gaius Plinius Secundus mentioned Indian
        traders carrying away large masses of gold and silver from Rome, in
        payment for skins, precious stones, clothes, indigo, sandalwood, herbs,
        perfumes, and spices. During 5-10 AD, Kalinga conquered Western Java,
        Sumatra and Malaya. The Andaman and Nicobar Islands served as an
        important halt point for trade ships en route to these nations and as
        well as China.
      </p>
      <h1 className="navyheading3">Middle Ages</h1>
      <p className="navypara103">
        Medieval Empires in the Indian subcontinent further developed their
        naval forces. During 844-848 AD the daily revenue from these nations was
        expected to be around 200 maunds (8 tonnes (7.9 long tons; 8.8 short
        tons)) of gold. During 984-1042 AD, under the reign of Raja Raja Chola
        I, Rajendra Chola I and Kulothunga Chola I, a naval expedition by the
        Chola dynasty captured parts of Burma, Sumatra, Sri Lanka, and Malaya,
        and simultaneously repressed pirate activities by Sumatran warlords.
        Marco Polo's remark on Indian ships (1292 AD) ... built of fir timber,
        having a sheath of boards laid over the planking in every part, caulked
        with oakum and fastened with iron nails. The bottoms were smeared with a
        preparation of quicklime and hemp, pounded together and mixed with oil
        from a certain tree which is a better material than pith.During the 14th
        and 15th centuries, Indian shipbuilding and maritime abilities skill set
        exceeded European capabilities at the time. Their ships could carry over
        a hundred crew and were compartmentalized to limit the effect of damage
        keeping the ship afloat.

      <h1 className="navyheading4"></h1>
      <p className="navypara104">
        Following independence and the partition of India on 15 August 1947, the
        RIN's depleted fleet of ships and remaining personnel were divided
        between the newly independent Dominion of India and Dominion of
        Pakistan. 21 per cent of the Navy's officer cadre and 47 per cent of its
        sailors opted to join the portion of the fleet which became the Royal
        Pakistan Navy. The Indian share of the Navy consisted of 32 vessels
        along with 11,000 personnel. Effective from the same date, all British
        officers were compulsorily retired from the Navy and its reserve
        components, with Indian officers being promoted to replace British
        senior officers. However, a number of British flag and senior officers
        were invited to continue serving in the RIN, as only nine of the Navy's
        Indian commissioned officers had more than 10 years' service, with the
        majority of them only having served from five to eight years. Rear
        Admiral John Talbot Savignac Hall headed the Navy as its first
        Commander-in-Chief (C-in-C) post-Independence. In January 1948, D.N.
        Mukherji, the first Indian officer in the RIN, became the first Indian
        to be promoted acting engineer captain. In May 1948, Captain Ajitendu
        Chakraverti became the first Indian officer to be appointed to the rank
        of commodore. When India became a republic on 26 January 1950, the Royal
        prefix was dropped and the name Indian Navy was officially adopted. The
        prefix for naval vessels was changed from His Majesty's Indian Ship
        (HMIS) to Indian Naval Ship (INS). At the same time, the imperial crown
        in insignia was replaced with the Lion Capital of Ashoka and the Union
        Jack in the canton of the White Ensign was replaced with the Indian
        Tricolour. By 1955, the Navy had largely overcome its post-Independence
        personnel shortfalls. During the early years following independence,
        many British officers continued to serve in the Navy on secondment from
        the Royal Navy, due to the post-Independence retirement or transfer of
        many experienced officers to the Royal or the Pakistan navies. The first
        C-in-C of the Navy was Admiral Sir Edward Parry who took over from Hall
        in 1948 and handed over to Admiral Sir Charles Thomas Mark Pizey in
        1951. Admiral Pizey also became the first Chief of the Naval Staff in
        1955, and was succeeded by Vice Admiral Sir Stephen Hope Carlill the
        same year The pace of "Indianising" continued steadily through the
        1950s. By 1952, senior Naval appointments had begun to be filled by
        Indian officers, and by 1955, basic training for naval cadets was
        entirely conducted in India. In 1956, Ram Dass Katari became the first
        Indian flag officer, and was appointed the first Indian Commander of the
        Fleet on 2 October. On 22 April 1958, Vice Admiral Katari assumed the
        command of the Indian Navy from Carlill as the first Indian Chief of
        Staff of the Indian Navy. With the departure in 1962 of the last British
        officer on secondment to the Navy, Commodore David Kirke, the Chief of
        Naval Aviation, the Indian Navy finally became an entirely Indian
        service. The first engagement in action of the Indian Navy was against
        the Portuguese Navy during the liberation of Goa in 1961. Operation
        Vijay followed years of escalating tension due to Portuguese refusal to
        relinquish its colonies in India. On 21 November 1961, Portuguese troops
        fired on the passenger liner Sabarmati near Anjadip Island, killing one
        person and injuring another. During Operation Vijay, the Indian Navy
        supported troop landings and provided fire support. The cruiser INS
        Delhi sank one Portuguese patrol boat, while frigates INS Betwa and INS
        Beas destroyed the Portuguese frigate NRP Afonso de Albuquerque. The
        1962 Sino-Indian War was largely fought over the Himalayas and the Navy
        had only a defensive role in the war.

      <h1 className="navyheading5">21st century onwards</h1>
      <p className="navypara105">
        In the 21st century, the Indian Navy has played an important role in
        maintaining peace for India on the maritime front, in spite of the state
        of foment in its neighbourhood. It has been deployed for humanitarian
        relief in times of natural disasters and crises across the globe, as
        well as to keep India's maritime trade routes free and open. The Indian
        Navy was a part of the joint forces exercises, Operation Parakram,
        during the 2001–2002 India–Pakistan standoff. More than a dozen warships
        were deployed to the northern Arabian Sea. In October, the Indian Navy
        took over operations to secure the Strait of Malacca, to relieve US Navy
        resources for Operation Enduring Freedom. The navy plays an important
        role in providing humanitarian relief in times of natural disasters,
        including floods, cyclones and tsunamis. In the aftermath of the 2004
        Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, the Indian Navy launched massive
        disaster relief operations to help affected Indian states as well as
        Maldives, Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Over 27 ships, dozens of helicopters,
        at least six fixed-wing aircraft and over 5000 personnel of the navy
        were deployed in relief operations. These included Operation Madad in
        Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, Operation Sea Waves in the Andaman and
        Nicobar Islands, Operation Castor in Maldives, Operation Rainbow in Sri
        Lanka and Operation Gambhir in Indonesia. Gambhir, carried out following
        the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, was one of the largest and fastest force
        mobilisations that the Indian Navy has undertaken. Indian naval rescue
        vessels and teams reached neighbouring countries less than 12 hours from
        the time that the tsunami hit. Lessons from the response led to decision
        to enhance amphibious force capabilities, including the acquisition of
        landing platform docks such as INS Jalashwa, as well as smaller
        amphibious vessels.
      </p>
      <h1 className="navyheading6">Current role</h1>
      <p className="navypara106">
        As of August 2015, the Indian Navy is classified as a Rank 3 navy (Power
        projection to regions adjacent to its own) on the Todd-Lindberg navy
        classification system of naval strength. The principal roles of
        the Indian Navy are: In conjunction with other Armed Forces of
        the Union, act to deter or defeat any threats or aggression against the
        territory, people or maritime interests of India, both in war and peace;
        Project influence in India's maritime area of interest, to further the
        nation's political, economic and security objectives; In co-operation
        with the Indian Coast Guard, ensure good order and stability in India's
        maritime zones of responsibility. Provide maritime assistance (including
        disaster relief) in India's maritime neighbourhood.
